# Slot_Machine
  
This project is inspired from the original slot machine, where the user can play the game, and bet on the randomly generated symbols in rows and columns, and can either earn profits or loose the money.

In this project, I have developed a text-based slot machine, which is originally a 3 rows and 3 columns game, but can be easily modified based on the requirement.

The below functions can be performed in this code.
- Can randomly generate symbols in each slot of each row and column, and
- A user can bet on each row, and can gain profits if all the randomly generated symbols are same in a particular row, that user has bet on, and can perform the following operations.
    - Deposit money into the account to bet
    - Bet on the slot
    - Gain Profits
    - Calculate Profits and losses
    - withdraw profits from the account.
