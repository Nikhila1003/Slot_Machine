# Slot_Machine
 
This project is inspired from the original slot machine, where the user can play the game, and bet on the symbols that are randomly generates the symbols in rows and columns, and can either earn profits or loose the money.
In this project, I have developed a text-based slot machine, which is originally a 3 rows and 3 columns game,
- that can randomly generate symbols in each slot.
- A user can play the game and bet on each row and can perform the following operations.
    - Deposit money into the account to bet
    - Bet on the slot
    - Gain Profits
    - Calculate Profits and losses
    - withdraw profits from the account.
